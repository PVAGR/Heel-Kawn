# Contributing to Heel-Kawn Multiplayer Mod

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Heel-Kawn Multiplayer Mod for WorldBox!

This document outlines how to get started, guidelines for contributing, and the project’s conventions.

---

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/PVAGR/Heel-Kawn.git
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment**
   - Install [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) (5.x) for WorldBox modding.
   - Obtain a copy of WorldBox (Steam).
   - Reference WorldBox assemblies in your C# project (`Assembly-CSharp.dll`, etc.).
   - Use Visual Studio or Rider for best IntelliSense and debugging.

3. **Build**
   - Place source files in your BepInEx plugins folder or build to DLL and copy there.
   - Launch WorldBox to test.

4. **Twitch Integration**
   - Generate a Twitch OAuth token: https://twitchapps.com/tmi/
   - Set up your Twitch username and channel in the mod config (`BepInEx/config`).

## Conventions

- Namespace: `HeelKawnPlugin`
- Organize new features in their own files (e.g., `MagicSystem.cs`, `DiplomacyManager.cs`)
- Stub out new systems with logging before implementing full logic.
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages.

## Contribution Guidelines

- **Issues & Suggestions:**  
  Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/PVAGR/Heel-Kawn/issues) for bug reports, feature requests, and questions.

- **Pull Requests:**  
  - Fork the repo, create a branch, and submit your PR.
  - Clearly describe your changes and reference related issues.
  - Keep PRs focused—avoid unrelated feature creep.

- **Coding Style:**  
  - Use C# conventions (PascalCase for class/methods, camelCase for variables).
  - Add XML comments for public methods/classes if possible.
  - Prefer clarity over cleverness.

- **Testing:**  
  - Test your changes in-game whenever possible.
  - Add log output for new systems to aid debugging.
