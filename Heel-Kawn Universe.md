“Krond” allows you to impact the world in multiple ways such as:  
 

* Utilizing the Magic System (See Below)  
* Grant New Traits  
* Summon X amount of citizens  
* Call for an election in a kingdom for you or someone else to become a lord or king (only able to against OTHER human players.)

Cartographers \- since everyone will be at a very zoomed in spot of viewing just there person and a few blocks in front of them while the rest of the map is either FOW or something similar, Cartographers will be able to traverse the land and map out new cities built, harbors being built, rivers,roads, etc. and put them on as many maps as they want so long as they have the necessary supplies to fill them out and sell them to travelers who do not have a map so they can be aware of what the world looks like politically, economically, etc. They will need to be constantly updated based on events occurring in the world, making cartographers full time jobs constantly traveling the world.

***War :***  
The only person who can declare war is the ruler of the realm. The king can NOT declare war instantly, it has to go through a process and through the right people in order to go through.

When the King wishes to declare war they must prepare months in in-game time or hours in real-time.

He first must go to his personal kings council, in which they take a vote on whether to proceed with the logistics and expenses of what's to come with war. if they vote 3-2 for the war they can go to the next step.

If the first council goes through then the grand emisar must immediately call upon his messengers throughout the realm and let them know to send their local lords of each village to the Capital which depending on the distance may take a week or two of in-game time or 30 minutes of real-time.  

Once every lord arrives the senate vote takes place. so around 50-60 votes might take place with each lord having 1 vote. (maybe 2-5 votes per lord depending on conditions met, {been through multiple wars and won, loyalty, kills, etc.} 

so if the vote is voted 34-33 for, the war prep continues, and vice-versa.

Once a decision takes place from the aggressor the Grand Emisar must immediately send the defender the declaration.

If the aggressor kingdom fails to do this condition then any other kingdom or village can revolt without giving them notice during that war time.

the BattleMaster and Ruler Convene to check each village's realm and how many people they can muster to fight. 

They come up with a quota for each lord with how many soldiers to bring from their respective lands. 

They have them meet at a respected place to organize.

The lords go and tell the citizens what is going to happen in the next 2-3 months of in-game time or hour of real-time.

Once the armies have gathered for both respected kingdoms (depending on how large the respected kingdoms are) 

The BattleMaster may separate the army into multiple battalions. (Western battalion,Northern battalion, etc.)

After this a hierarchy is established on the battlefield:

BattleMaster  
Commanders  
Captains  
Sarj

BattleMaster- meets with the BattleMaster of the defending kingdom to Oversee every theater of war and discuss where their respective Battalions are going to be battling with the other. Each battle site must be agreed upon by both parties.

only required for the first battle for each battalion.

 Can declare temporary ceasefire once mandatory war time is over, to discuss what to do next with the king.

In charge of All of the Kingdoms Fighting Men

Commanders- In charge of their respective Battalion, the only ones who get orders directly from the battlemaster

In charge of whichever battalion they are in charge of   
Battalion \= However many flag groups appointed by BattleMaster

Captains \- Take orders strictly from there respected commanders

In charge of 5 groups of flag armies.

Sarj- Takes orders straight from the Captains 

In charge of there specific flagged company

Commanders have authority to make as many captains as they believe they need, same for captains. BattleMasters can decide how many of each is needed as well.

Once agreed upon The battlemaster delegates which battalion is going to march to.

***Soldiers: The positions above are very prestigious and rewarded to only the citizens who have proved invaluable to the BattleMaster and the Commander and so on. Most citizens will participate as the bulk of the army, the grunts, however the higher ups forget how much the grunts can turn the tide of battle…***

***Once the war begins it is how it would be in real life, Anarchy, Once you are on the battlefield it's all open. Everyone who enforces the rules and dictates where battles take place are comfortable sitting at home while you are risking your life every minute you are there. Become Renown for your skill with the blade, a turncoat, a spy, a strategist, a healer, someone who is just trying to survive and flee. band with a group of friends you’ve made during the war and break off to create your own kingdom\!***

***The field of battle is for the soldiers who spill their blood.***

***(Magic may be restricted if abused during battles)***

It all began in a pixelated universe far far away…

3 billion light years from Roblox and a million from Minecraft…

A small galaxy named Heel-Kawn,

About Us

What separates us from all the other WorldBox videos you will see, is the dedication to world building and “living” in said world for weeks of real life time on one living planet.

We want to combine RPG elements and a multiplayer experience to a incredibly minute detail.

All what you know an love of WorldBox has been restricted and made into a community driven task. What that means is Any Earthquakes, diseases, rebellions that you see are in the world will be made by one of the “citizens”. We strive to be as hands-free as possible and let the world run its self.

Those “Citizens” are you, the player. The heart and soul of the entire world. Our goal is to create and host a server(s) that can host hundreds if not thousands of players to own and control 1 sprite in the world.

————————-  
crafting/professions sneak peek

In the future, with that sprite you will be able to

Become king and dictate policies in your kingdom

Become a sell sword selling your services to the highest bidder

A smith crafting the finest armaments

Cartographer traveling across the world and creating maps to sell to other citizens who have no idea what the rest of the world will  
Look like.

Healer healing diseased or injured people from battle or disease.

Or a simple boatswain crafting, selling, and sailing the finest boats in the sea.

And more\! See the video Class/Professions to see the details and how we plan to make these happen.  
—————————-

We will keep the world running and live streamed the entire time for people to see and participate in events ranging from local towns to world altering.

Everything is permanent, whatever happens in the world in those 7 days stays like that until the next world begins.

Once the 7 day timer ends the world is then saved and uploaded for everyone to enjoy.

——————-

New Systems:

We plan on implementing all kinds of features including a War-time hierarchy System , Magic system, Political kingdom system, currency, class,professions. Etc.

if you wish to know more about any of these certain features we will be creating separate videos dedicated to each one of them in full detail as it will be too much to explain here.

——————-

Community Driven

Everything we are building comes with the community in mind first. What we want to do is build and have the people decide on there own how they would like to use it, that’s what makes a static world breathe life and dynamics. Creating fictional history in real time.

——————

Inspiration

If you are still curious about what we might represent, think DnD, Game of Thrones, MapWars, Mount and blade Bannerlord, and crusader kings.

With every system we implement we took these as our inspirations and source.

————-

“Historical” Documentation

I, personally, love history. especially fictional history since ours can be a bit bleak and sad most of the time. However I always saw the problem with fictional history is that it has already been set in stone and written out for us to enjoy, usually that’s okay if the writings good but I for one, always had a “what if this happened instead of this” hoping other possibilities were to happen instead. Questioning canon I believe is a stone cold truth that is bitter sweet, so I thought why not create the canon as we go\! While your citizen is living in that world you are participating in active history, making your digital pixelated footprint in that world for all to see. Even with that concept people who weren’t in that first world will wish they were. Which is why we recycle and create a new world every couple weeks for new people to join from the very beginning\!

With that being said another goal is too make a wiki page, documenting every major and minor event occurring in that world and having its own separate wiki page for all to enjoy after the world ends so people can reminisce and see the impact there character had.

It will display

what major wars happened and when  
(Green vs Purple 2239 AT)

* Major battles that occurred  
* Rare and powerful monsters and citizens alike and there deeds.  
* Masterfully crafted equipment

Would even like to implement a battle map updating every 200 years or so or whenever a major war has taken place.

———————

Closing Remarks

With all that being said, This is a massive project we are taking on, everything fully conceptualized and originally designed from the ground up. So creating the code and art work for this will take a massive amount of  
time as it’s just me and one other worldbox developer currently.

UNFORTUNATELY We do have real lives to maintain to afford utilities and rent so that will also hinder the release date as we can not put our 100% focus on the project.

Down below is a Patreon/ kickstarter fundraiser, However, this is me real talk. this isn’t going to a charity or any altruistic goal like that. It will be going directly to me to be able to pay myself to continue putting overseeing the production to make sure all my concepts are fleshed out as well as financing developers who are not interested to do it out of the good of there heart but will put in work programming/designing aspects for a fee. This will speed up the release date exponentially.

There’s no other way for you to trust me besides knowing this entire idea and concept came from me as well as this video edited and I even wrote a script in my notes app late at night after coming up with the fact I was going to make it myself. I had asked the worldbox steam community and the discord community for assistance to no avail besides some slight help from a developer who I hope to work with in the future.

the expected release as of right now will be in late 2024 early 2025\. but if we are able to get more people on the team that date could be reduced majorly.

Prometheus :

There stood a world where our first story takes place… a small terrestrial planet, Prometheus.

The world is beautiful, quiet, peaceful. 2 continents , BayMin in the NorthWest, Cythera in the South East.

At the beginning of time there was only one way to each continent, They called it the crossing.

Before primitive life came along to the world the land was roamed by nothing but beautiful beast and the lush green grass, with the cycle of nature continuing.

Make a grid out of whatever size coordinate grid for map and have coordinates chatters be able to summon/use whatever on specific coordinate at specific time

Year 1 BT Before Thiago

Than.. Man arrived, seemingly “out of nowhere” arriving in the Cythera.

They remained local and sparse for a 1000 years , learning how to fish, build  
homes, and to sail once they find a river.
