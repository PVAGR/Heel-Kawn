# Tech Tree Roadmap ‚Äì Chronicles of Heel-Kawn

This roadmap outlines the phased development path for the Heel-Kawn project, from the narrative proto-game to a fully automated, blockchain-enabled multiplayer mod for WorldBox.

## üå± Tech Level 0: Manual Proto-Game (Current Phase)

**Objective:**  
Validate that people will engage deeply with collaborative, lore-driven worldbuilding, using existing tools and minimal automation.

**Features:**
- Manual Discord/Google Docs for community and lore tracking
- Twitch chat voting via Nightbot/StreamElements

- Daily live events narrated on stream

**Tools:**  
Twitch, Discord, Google Docs, Nightbot, Google Sheets

Reduce manual overhead by automating core interactions between Twitch, Discord, and WorldBox.

**Features:**
- Custom Twitch/Discord bot for:
    - `!join` (spawns villager, assigns code)
    - `!pray` (tracks prayers for units)
    - `!vote` (automates event voting)
    - Auto Discord role assignment
    - Basic villager tracking and action mapping
- Basic save/load of player data (JSON or SQLite)

- BepInEx/Unity mod enables:
    - Direct control: chat commands trigger AI actions (move, farm, build, fight, etc.)
    - Real-time player-to-villager mapping
    - Dynamic trait/magic/event assignment
    - In-game voting systems and war declarations
- Blockchain/NFT integration for unique player codes (optional)

## üõ§Ô∏è Long-Term Vision

- Dedicated server support (always-on worlds)
- Cross-session and cross-world player legacy
- Marketplace for villager codes and in-game artifacts (PVA Bazaar integration)
- Advanced diplomacy, trade, and player-driven governance systems
- Rich lore wiki with automated history exports
