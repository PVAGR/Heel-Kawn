# Heel-Kawn Multiplayer Mod – Tech Tree Roadmap

This file tracks the staged development plan for the Heel-Kawn WorldBox multiplayer mod. Each “Tech Level” represents a milestone of new capabilities, complexity, and community features.

---

## Tech Level I: Foundation

- [x] BepInEx plugin loads cleanly; logging working
- [x] TwitchBot stub listens for commands (no real IRC yet)
- [x] PlayerManager: players join, unique codes, action queues
- [x] ActionQueueProcessor: stub tick loop for processing queued actions
- [x] WorldBoxAPIHelper: stub for spawning/moving units (logs only)
- [x] VillageManager: basic village/kingdom tracking
- [x] ConfigManager: loads Twitch credentials + options
- [x] README scaffold

---

## Tech Level II: Real Multiplayer

- [ ] TwitchBot: full IRC integration (via TwitchLib or TCP)
- [ ] Parse Twitch chat for !join, !move, !pray, !farm, !build, etc.
- [ ] Spawn villagers in WorldBox on !join (via reflection)
- [ ] Move villagers in-game on !move; update positions
- [ ] Assign basic traits via chat (!trait X)
- [ ] “Pray” for King/Lord (vote to elevate players)
- [ ] Villager death/respawn cycle (via chat or in-game events)
- [ ] Persist player/village/kingdom state to disk (JSON/SQLite)

---

## Tech Level III: RPG & Strategy Layer

- [ ] Classes and Professions (Bila, Trot, etc.)
- [ ] Skill progression, profession lock-in
- [ ] Trait system: earn/buy traits (minor/average/major/divine)
- [ ] Krond currency: earn, spend, transfer
- [ ] Magic system: cast spells via chat/krond/donations
- [ ] Kingdom diplomacy (alliances, war, peace, revolts)
- [ ] Council/senate votes for war/elections

---

## Tech Level IV: Community & Persistence

- [ ] Weekly world archiving, event log to wiki/discord
- [ ] Discord bot integration (echo events, stats, major changes)
- [ ] Map overlays/UI in mod for streamer and viewers
- [ ] Web dashboard: real-time stats, villager/kingdom info
- [ ] “Legendary deeds” system (track heroics, betrayals, etc.)

---

## Tech Level V: Endgame & Automation

- [ ] Automated season resets, world generation, and event scripting
- [ ] Custom biomes, disasters, and large-scale magic
- [ ] AI-driven empires or gods for world dynamism
- [ ] Streaming overlays/game events for audience
- [ ] In-game event triggers for streamer chat

## Notes

- Each “Tech Level” is a milestone! Don’t move on until previous level is stable for public playtesting.
- Community feedback and lore integration are key at every stage.
