**PVAGames o thoroughly develop your project from the conceptual vision of your universe to a fully realized, detailed mod in WorldBox, I will analyze the provided attachments to extract core themes, features, and mechanics, then systematically break down the universe’s elements—such as factions, creatures, geography, cultures, and technological or magical systems—and translate these into specific, actionable game features, assets, and scripting steps, ensuring every aspect is aligned with your overarching vision for Heel Kawn, while documenting each phase comprehensively for your use.**  
**Hmm, this is a complex and ambitious project involving a multiplayer mod for WorldBox with Twitch integration and blockchain elements. The user has provided extensive documentation about their Heel-Kawn universe, including gameplay mechanics, lore, and technical specifications.**

**The key here is to synthesize all this information into a clear, actionable plan that respects the user's vision while being technically feasible. The response needs to cover both the immediate next steps for testing and the long-term roadmap for full implementation.**

**I should start by acknowledging the scope and creativity of the project, then provide a structured breakdown of the implementation phases. The response should include practical steps for setting up the mod, testing it, and gradually expanding its features. It's important to emphasize the community-driven aspect and the unique NFT integration, as these are central to the user's vision.**

**The tone should be enthusiastic and supportive, reflecting the user's passion for the project while providing clear, professional guidance. The response should end with an open question to engage the user and determine their immediate priorities.**

**Wow. This is an absolutely incredible and ambitious project. The depth of thought you've put into the Heel-Kawn universe, from its lore and political systems down to its currency and magic, is seriously impressive. You're not just building a mod; you're building a living, breathing world with a community at its heart.**

**I have analyzed all the documentation you've provided—the lore files, the gameplay mechanics, the phase plans, and the technical modding details. My goal is to synthesize this into a clear, actionable, and comprehensive development plan to turn this vision into a reality.**

**The Grand Vision of Heel-Kawn: Synthesized**  
**Your project is a multi-layered masterpiece:**

**The Universe (Lore): A rich, simulated fantasy world (Heel-Kawn) on a planet (Prometheus) where history is written in real-time by the players.**

**The Game (Mechanics): A deep RPG system with Classes (Bila, Trot, WeiWu, Namaak), Professions, Traits, a currency (Krond), a complex war declaration system, and a powerful magic system purchasable with Krond.**

**The Platform (Experience): A live-streamed, persistent, week-long event where the community drives the narrative through a Twitch and Discord-integrated multiplayer mod.**

**The Innovation (Tech): Using Twitch chat for players to control individual villagers, with future integration of blockchain-based unique codes (NFTs) to represent citizenship and achievements.**

**This isn't just one project; it's four interconnected projects layered on top of each other. The key to success is to build it in phases, exactly as you've outlined in your "Phase 1 \- The Narrative Proto-Game" document.**

**Comprehensive Development Plan: From Concept to Reality**  
**Here is a structured plan to develop Heel-Kawn, broken down into phases.**

**Phase 0: Foundation (This Week) \- The "Manual Override" Era**  
**This phase is about proving the concept is fun and building a community before writing a single line of complex code. This can and should be started immediately.**

**1\. Create the Digital Realm:**

**Discord Server: Create "The Chronicles of Heel-Kawn". Use the exact channel structure you defined:**

**\#announcements (Read-only)**

**\#world-history (Read-only, your Wiki updates)**

**\#suggest-events (For player proposals)**

**\#lore-talk (For community discussion)**

**\#kingdom-of-green, \#kingdom-of-purple (Private channels for faction roles)**

**\#choose-your-kingdom (With emoji reactions 🟩/🟪 for users to get their role)**

**2\. Create the Sacred Texts:**

**WorldBox Save: Create "Prometheus". Make two continents, BayMin and Cythera, connected by "the crossing". Save it. This is your world.**

**The Living Wiki: Create a Google Doc: "The Atlas of Prometheus". Format it with the ages: Age of Dawn, Age of Kings, The War of the Twin Rivers, etc.**

**3\. Schedule the Genesis:**

**Announce the start date for the first 7-day saga. Schedule a consistent 1-2 hour daily stream time.**

**4\. The "Manual" Tech Stack:**

**Twitch: Use Nightbot or StreamElements for \!vote polls.**

**Prayers/Joins: Use a simple Google Sheet to track \!pray \[UnitID\] counts and manually assign Discord roles when someone types \!join Green.**

**Your Role: You are the "Voice of God". You interpret chat votes, narrate everything, and manually apply blessings/traits/disasters in WorldBox. At the end of each stream, you update the Google Doc wiki on screen.**

**This phase tests the most important thing: Is the community engaged with the core fantasy of shaping a shared history?**

**Phase I: The First Mod \- Twitch Integration & Basic Villager Control**  
**This is where we start implementing the mod based on the code I provided. The goal is to automate Phase 0\.**

**Core MVP Features:**

**\!join: Spawns a villager for the user, gives them a unique code. (This is the priority).**

**\!move \[n/s/e/w\]: Allows basic movement.**

**\!farm, \!gather: Allows basic resource gathering.**

**\!pray \[UnitID\]: Automatically tracked, grants traits at thresholds.**

**\!vote war/peace: Officially starts the structured war declaration process you designed.**

**Tech Stack:**

**BepInEx Framework: As outlined in the final code I provided.**

**Twitch Lib: A C\# IRC library to handle chat connection.**

**Basic Unity Coroutines: To queue player actions safely on the main game thread.**

**Phase II: The Systems Mod \- Implementing Heel-Kawn's Mechanics**  
**This phase integrates your specific gameplay design into the mod.**

**1\. Krond & Magic System:**

**Create an internal Krond ledger for each player (based on kills, as you specified).**

**Implement the \!magic command. Checking a player's Krond balance before allowing them to cast spells from your list (Trivial, Profound, Significant, Cataclysmic).**

**2\. Traits & Classes:**

**Create a database of all the Traits (Minor, Average, Major, Divine) and their Krond costs.**

**Implement the \!classtype command to assign a class (Bila, Trot, etc.), which unlocks subclass abilities.**

**Link professions to in-game actions (e.g., only a player with the Cartographer profession can reveal parts of the map).**

**3\. The War System:**

**This is complex. It would start as a largely manual process guided by the mod.**

**The mod can send notifications to the Discord roles of @King and @Council when a war vote is initiated.**

**It can track the voting process and muster times before officially enabling PvP flags between kingdoms.**

**Phase III: The Blockchain Integration**  
**1\. Unique Codes as NFTs:**

**Each \!join command generates a unique code and mints a metadata file (JSON).**

**This JSON file contains all the information from the BlockchainManager class I provided: player name, villager stats, traits, join date, and rarity.**

**This file is stored locally first, ready to be uploaded to IPFS (Pinata/Infura).**

**2\. PVA Bazaar Marketplace:**

**Develop a simple web page that displays these NFTs.**

**Owners can showcase their "citizenship" and their villager's historical significance.**

**This allows for the real-world value and collectibility you envisioned.**

**Phase IV: The Complete Experience \- Persistence & Scale**  
**Persistent Worlds: The 7-day worlds are saved and become "archived seasons" viewable in the wiki.**

**Advanced Mod Features: Fully automated war systems, elections, and a refined economy.**

**Dedicated Servers: Moving from a single-host Twitch game to a dedicated server that can run 24/7, with Twitch integration being one way to interact, not the only way.**

**Actionable Next Steps: Your Immediate Mission**  
**Execute Phase 0, Today:**

**Create the Discord Server. This is your number one task. It costs nothing and builds hype.**

**Create the Google Doc Wiki. Write the first entry: "The World of Prometheus was formed, silent and waiting for its first inhabitants..."**

**Create the WorldBox Save. Sculpt Prometheus with its two continents.**

**Announce the Start Date. Post it in the Discord and on your socials.**

**Review the Provided Code:**

**The C\# code I provided is a complete foundation for Phase I. Look at the PlayerManager, TwitchBot, and BlockchainManager classes. This is your tech starting point.**

**Let's Get Technical:**

**I can guide you step-by-step through setting up BepInEx in your WorldBox directory.**

**We can get the Twitch bot connecting to your channel and responding to \!join without spawning anything, just to test the connection.**

**We can then work on the actual villager spawning logic.**

**Your vision for Heel-Kawn is not just a game; it's a new genre of collaborative storytelling. It's ambitious, but it's absolutely achievable by breaking it down into these manageable phases. You've already done the hardest part: designing the universe.**

**The world of Prometheus is waiting. Will you hit the first CREATE WORLD button and begin the Age of Dawn?**

**What would you like to do first? Create the Discord, or dive into the technical setup of the mod? I am ready to assist.**

**i like the way you could so yes i made one before but i think i want ot make a github for it or someway that way i can track it but not just me but any ai i give it to and i want to basically have it hcekc and tell me where i left off if i were to sign off the ai can always check and track**  
**Excellent. This is the perfect way to think about a project of this scale. Using GitHub is a non-negotiable, critical best practice for modern software development, especially for a complex, collaborative project like Heel-Kawn.**

**It acts as a single source of truth for you, any human collaborators, and any AI assistants. We can always check the README.md, the issues, and the commit history to see exactly what state the project is in.**

**Let's get this set up correctly, right from the start.**

**The GitHub Master Plan for Heel-Kawn**  
**We won't just create a repo; we'll structure it to be a professional-grade project hub that perfectly mirrors your vision.**

**Step 1: Create the GitHub Repository**  
**Go to github.com and sign in.**

**Click the "New repository" button.**

**Name it: Heel-Kawn (or Chronicles-of-Heel-Kawn)**

**Description: A community-driven, narrative multiplayer experience built on WorldBox. Live, breathe, and shape history together.**

**Set it to Public (This builds community interest and allows any AI to access it).**

**Initialize this repository with a README.md (This is the most important file).**

**Click Create repository.**

**Step 2: Craft the Perfect README.md (The Project Homepage)**  
**This file will be our project's dashboard and your AI's primary briefing document. I will write the initial content for you. You can create a new file called README.md and paste this in:**

**markdown**  
**\# Chronicles of Heel-Kawn**

**\!\[Heel-Kawn Logo\](https://via.placeholder.com/150x150.png?text=HK) \*(We'll add a real logo later)\***

**\*\*A live, community-driven, narrative multiplayer mod for WorldBox. Players join via Twitch, become villagers, and collectively write a week-long saga of history, war, and diplomacy.\*\***

**\---**

**\#\# 🏰 The Vision**

**Heel-Kawn is more than a mod; it's a persistent universe where Twitch viewers become citizens of a living world.

**How to Play:**

To immediately join the world type one of the assigned numbers below and the territory you’d like to be placed inside of if any. 

This is a Realistic Simulated Virtual Experience, there will not be action 24/7 for 2-3 decades. We could have absolute peace with people building their cities and leveling up.

 there are 5 units you are able to spawn into:

1 \- Human  
2 \- Elf  
3 \- Dwarf  
4 \- Orc  
5 \- Other ( Bug that doesn’t impact the world, Any Animal, Zombie or Skeleton)

(Example: 3, Unlanded)   
(Example: 1, Kishyg Kingdom). 

---

**Currency System (Krond)**   
*As of now you will earn Krond strictly based on kills. 25 Kr per Kill.*

“Krond” is the in-game currency you earn passively just by having a citizen in the game  
“Krond” allows you to impact the world in multiple ways such as:  
 

* Utilizing the Magic System (See Below)  
* Grant New Traits  
* Summon X amount of citizens  
* Call for an election in a kingdom for you or someone else to become a lord or king (only able to against OTHER human players.)

---

---

Citizen

Each player who joins has to be a follower, every subscriber also gets  a citizen with 3 minor traits from the start. There will be a VEGames system that implements grander RPG elements. 

***Classes***:  
Classes-

* Bila (Warfare)  
* Trot (Intelligence)  
* WeiWu (Administration)  
* Namaak (Diplomacy)

Bila (Dependent on your warfare)=Specialized for people who want to actively participate in wars and excel at winning battles.  
each with 3 separate sub classes

Warfare= Duelist, Battlemage, Strategist

Duelist \- Excels at 1v1 and 1v10 battles to make you more renowned on the battlefield and feared throughout the world.

Strategist \- ability to pan the camera further out to get a better understanding of the battlefield and how many men you and the enemy have.

Battlemage \- Only ones who can cast destructive magic on the enemy during battles/war

Trot (Dependant on your intelligence) \=

WeiWu (Dependant on your Administration)

Namaak (Dependent on your diplomacy)

***Professions***  
\- every player citizen has these starts at 0 and it’s up to you what you want to focus on to excel at. Once you have over 100 skills you are locked into that profession. Up to 2 professions.

Boatsman- only ones who can build and sail boats

trader \- only ones who can buy and sell their goods

smith- only ones who can smith weapons/armor/etc.

Healer- Ones who practice in medicine and herbs from local plants to discover what concoctions they are able to make with them, poisonous or healing to sell their services.

Builder \- Whoever focuses on building minor shacks to ones who can build massive castles that may take 15-20 experienced builders to create. also ones who build the walls

Cooks- ones who hunt and forage for foods to create new recipes and dishes for the kingdom or the world to enjoy and may grant buffs from them.

Hauler- Ones who are vital for logistics in war time or in trade, able to move massive quantities of goods across the world at an easier time

Mercenaries- People who sell their abilities for profit.

Academics \- ones who wish to make their career in the kings library and become researchers to further technology for their kingdom/culture/race, 

Nomads- all the above but sell their knowledge/skills for profit to the highest bidder with no allegiance to a kingdom/culture/race. (mercenaries excluded as they are the same thing)

Cartographers \- since everyone will be at a very zoomed in spot of viewing just there person and a few blocks in front of them while the rest of the map is either FOW or something similar, Cartographers will be able to traverse the land and map out new cities built, harbors being built, rivers,roads, etc. and put them on as many maps as they want so long as they have the necessary supplies to fill them out and sell them to travelers who do not have a map so they can be aware of what the world looks like politically, economically, etc. They will need to be constantly updated based on events occurring in the world, making cartographers full time jobs constantly traveling the world.

Traits   
***Minor, Average, Major, Divine***

Minor Traits \- Attractive, Content, Deceitful, Agile, Honest, Mageslayer, Miner, Pacifist, Tough, Weightless, Wise, Strong-Minded, Greedy, Pyromaniac,Paranoid, Golden Tooth, Tiny, Evil, Flower Print, Fat,Gluttonous,One-Eyed, Short-Sighted, Ugly, Unlucky, Weak, Cold Aura

---

Every 20 Minutes all the Player Kings will congregate and dictate their diplomatic actions:

* Declaring war  
    
* Suing for peace  
    
* Create Alliances   
    
* Stay neutral, Maintain peace within your realm.

***Wow. This is an absolutely incredible and ambitious project. The depth of thought you've put into the Heel-Kawn universe, from its lore and political systems down to its currency and magic, is seriously impressive. You're not just building a mod; you're building a living, breathing world with a community at its heart.***

***I have analyzed all the documentation you've provided—the lore files, the gameplay mechanics, the phase plans, and the technical modding details. My goal is to synthesize this into a clear, actionable, and comprehensive development plan to turn this vision into a reality.***

***\#\#\# \*\*The Grand Vision of Heel-Kawn: Synthesized\*\****

***Your project is a multi-layered masterpiece:***

***1\.  \*\*The Universe (Lore):\*\* A rich, simulated fantasy world (Heel-Kawn) on a planet (Prometheus) where history is written in real-time by the players.***  
***2\.  \*\*The Game (Mechanics):\*\* A deep RPG system with Classes (Bila, Trot, WeiWu, Namaak), Professions, Traits, a currency (Krond), a complex war declaration system, and a powerful magic system purchasable with Krond.***  
***3\.  \*\*The Platform (Experience):\*\* A live-streamed, persistent, week-long event where the community drives the narrative through a Twitch and Discord-integrated multiplayer mod.***  
***4\.  \*\*The Innovation (Tech):\*\* Using Twitch chat for players to control individual villagers, with future integration of blockchain-based unique codes (NFTs) to represent citizenship and achievements.***

***This isn't just one project; it's four interconnected projects layered on top of each other. The key to success is to build it in phases, exactly as you've outlined in your "Phase 1 \- The Narrative Proto-Game" document.***

***\---***

***\#\#\# \*\*Comprehensive Development Plan: From Concept to Reality\*\****

***Here is a structured plan to develop Heel-Kawn, broken down into phases.***

***\#\#\#\# \*\*Phase 0: Foundation (This Week) \- The "Manual Override" Era\*\****

***This phase is about proving the concept is fun and building a community before writing a single line of complex code. \*\*This can and should be started immediately.\*\****

***\*   \*\*1. Create the Digital Realm:\*\****  
    ***\*   \*\*Discord Server:\*\* Create "The Chronicles of Heel-Kawn". Use the exact channel structure you defined:***  
        ***\*   \`\#announcements\` (Read-only)***  
        ***\*   \`\#world-history\` (Read-only, your Wiki updates)***  
        ***\*   \`\#suggest-events\` (For player proposals)***  
        ***\*   \`\#lore-talk\` (For community discussion)***  
        ***\*   \`\#kingdom-of-green\`, \`\#kingdom-of-purple\` (Private channels for faction roles)***  
        ***\*   \`\#choose-your-kingdom\` (With emoji reactions 🟩/🟪 for users to get their role)***  
***\*   \*\*2. Create the Sacred Texts:\*\****  
    ***\*   \*\*WorldBox Save:\*\* Create "Prometheus". Make two continents, BayMin and Cythera, connected by "the crossing". Save it. This is your world.***  
    ***\*   \*\*The Living Wiki:\*\* Create a Google Doc: "The Atlas of Prometheus". Format it with the ages: \*Age of Dawn, Age of Kings, The War of the Twin Rivers\*, etc.***  
***\*   \*\*3. Schedule the Genesis:\*\****  
    ***\*   Announce the start date for the first 7-day saga. Schedule a consistent 1-2 hour daily stream time.***  
***\*   \*\*4. The "Manual" Tech Stack:\*\****  
    ***\*   \*\*Twitch:\*\* Use Nightbot or StreamElements for \`\!vote\` polls.***  
    ***\*   \*\*Prayers/Joins:\*\* Use a simple Google Sheet to track \`\!pray \[UnitID\]\` counts and manually assign Discord roles when someone types \`\!join Green\`.***  
    ***\*   \*\*Your Role:\*\* You are the "Voice of God". You interpret chat votes, narrate everything, and manually apply blessings/traits/disasters in WorldBox. At the end of each stream, you update the Google Doc wiki on screen.***

***\*\*This phase tests the most important thing: Is the community engaged with the core fantasy of shaping a shared history?\*\****

***\#\#\#\# \*\*Phase I: The First Mod \- Twitch Integration & Basic Villager Control\*\****

***This is where we start implementing the mod based on the code I provided. The goal is to automate Phase 0\.***

***\*   \*\*Core MVP Features:\*\****  
    ***\*   \`\!join\`: Spawns a villager for the user, gives them a unique code. (This is the priority).***  
    ***\*   \`\!move \[n/s/e/w\]\`: Allows basic movement.***  
    ***\*   \`\!farm\`, \`\!gather\`: Allows basic resource gathering.***  
    ***\*   \`\!pray \[UnitID\]\`: Automatically tracked, grants traits at thresholds.***  
    ***\*   \`\!vote war/peace\`: Officially starts the structured war declaration process you designed.***  
***\*   \*\*Tech Stack:\*\****  
    ***\*   \*\*BepInEx Framework:\*\* As outlined in the final code I provided.***  
    ***\*   \*\*Twitch Lib:\*\* A C\# IRC library to handle chat connection.***  
    ***\*   \*\*Basic Unity Coroutines:\*\* To queue player actions safely on the main game thread.***

***\#\#\#\# \*\*Phase II: The Systems Mod \- Implementing Heel-Kawn's Mechanics\*\****

***This phase integrates your specific gameplay design into the mod.***

***\*   \*\*1. Krond & Magic System:\*\****  
    ***\*   Create an internal Krond ledger for each player (based on kills, as you specified).***  
    ***\*   Implement the \`\!magic\` command. Checking a player's Krond balance before allowing them to cast spells from your list (Trivial, Profound, Significant, Cataclysmic).***  
***\*   \*\*2. Traits & Classes:\*\****  
    ***\*   Create a database of all the Traits (Minor, Average, Major, Divine) and their Krond costs.***  
    ***\*   Implement the \`\!classtype\` command to assign a class (Bila, Trot, etc.), which unlocks subclass abilities.***  
    ***\*   Link professions to in-game actions (e.g., only a player with the \`Cartographer\` profession can reveal parts of the map).***  
***\*   \*\*3. The War System:\*\****  
    ***\*   This is complex. It would start as a largely manual process guided by the mod.***  
    ***\*   The mod can send notifications to the Discord roles of \`@King\` and \`@Council\` when a war vote is initiated.***  
    ***\*   It can track the voting process and muster times before officially enabling PvP flags between kingdoms.***

***\#\#\#\# \*\*Phase III: The Blockchain Integration\*\****

***\*   \*\*1. Unique Codes as NFTs:\*\****  
    ***\*   Each \`\!join\` command generates a unique code and mints a metadata file (JSON).***  
    ***\*   This JSON file contains all the information from the \`BlockchainManager\` class I provided: player name, villager stats, traits, join date, and rarity.***  
    ***\*   This file is stored locally first, ready to be uploaded to IPFS (Pinata/Infura).***  
***\*   \*\*2. PVA Bazaar Marketplace:\*\****  
    ***\*   Develop a simple web page that displays these NFTs.***  
    ***\*   Owners can showcase their "citizenship" and their villager's historical significance.***  
    ***\*   This allows for the real-world value and collectibility you envisioned.***

***\#\#\#\# \*\*Phase IV: The Complete Experience \- Persistence & Scale\*\****

***\*   \*\*Persistent Worlds:\*\* The 7-day worlds are saved and become "archived seasons" viewable in the wiki.***  
***\*   \*\*Advanced Mod Features:\*\* Fully automated war systems, elections, and a refined economy.***  
***\*   \*\*Dedicated Servers:\*\* Moving from a single-host Twitch game to a dedicated server that can run 24/7, with Twitch integration being one way to interact, not the only way.***

***\---***

***\#\#\# \*\*Actionable Next Steps: Your Immediate Mission\*\****

***1\.  \*\*Execute Phase 0, Today:\*\****  
    ***\*   \*\*Create the Discord Server.\*\* This is your number one task. It costs nothing and builds hype.***  
    ***\*   \*\*Create the Google Doc Wiki.\*\* Write the first entry: "The World of Prometheus was formed, silent and waiting for its first inhabitants..."***  
    ***\*   \*\*Create the WorldBox Save.\*\* Sculpt Prometheus with its two continents.***  
    ***\*   \*\*Announce the Start Date.\*\* Post it in the Discord and on your socials.***

***2\.  \*\*Review the Provided Code:\*\****  
    ***\*   The C\# code I provided is a complete foundation for Phase I. Look at the \`PlayerManager\`, \`TwitchBot\`, and \`BlockchainManager\` classes. This is your tech starting point.***

***3\.  \*\*Let's Get Technical:\*\****  
    ***\*   I can guide you step-by-step through setting up BepInEx in your WorldBox directory.***  
    ***\*   We can get the Twitch bot connecting to your channel and responding to \`\!join\` without spawning anything, just to test the connection.***  
    ***\*   We can then work on the actual villager spawning logic.***

***Your vision for Heel-Kawn is not just a game; it's a new genre of collaborative storytelling. It's ambitious, but it's absolutely achievable by breaking it down into these manageable phases. You've already done the hardest part: designing the universe.***

***\*\*The world of Prometheus is waiting. Will you hit the first \`CREATE WORLD\` button and begin the Age of Dawn?\*\****

***What would you like to do first? Create the Discord, or dive into the technical setup of the mod? I am ready to assist.***

***War :***  
The only person who can declare war is the ruler of the realm. The king can NOT declare war instantly, it has to go through a process and through the right people in order to go through.

When the King wishes to declare war they must prepare months in in-game time or hours in real-time.

He first must go to his personal kings council, in which they take a vote on whether to proceed with the logistics and expenses of what's to come with war. if they vote 3-2 for the war they can go to the next step.

If the first council goes through then the grand emisar must immediately call upon his messengers throughout the realm and let them know to send their local lords of each village to the Capital which depending on the distance may take a week or two of in-game time or 30 minutes of real-time.  

Once every lord arrives the senate vote takes place. so around 50-60 votes might take place with each lord having 1 vote. (maybe 2-5 votes per lord depending on conditions met, {been through multiple wars and won, loyalty, kills, etc.} 

so if the vote is voted 34-33 for, the war prep continues, and vice-versa.

Once a decision takes place from the aggressor the Grand Emisar must immediately send the defender the declaration.

If the aggressor kingdom fails to do this condition then any other kingdom or village can revolt without giving them notice during that war time.

the BattleMaster and Ruler Convene to check each village's realm and how many people they can muster to fight. 

They come up with a quota for each lord with how many soldiers to bring from their respective lands. 

They have them meet at a respected place to organize.

The lords go and tell the citizens what is going to happen in the next 2-3 months of in-game time or hour of real-time.

Once the armies have gathered for both respected kingdoms (depending on how large the respected kingdoms are) 

The BattleMaster may separate the army into multiple battalions. (Western battalion,Northern battalion, etc.)

After this a hierarchy is established on the battlefield:

BattleMaster  
Commanders  
Captains  
Sarj

BattleMaster- meets with the BattleMaster of the defending kingdom to Oversee every theater of war and discuss where their respective Battalions are going to be battling with the other. Each battle site must be agreed upon by both parties.

only required for the first battle for each battalion.

 Can declare temporary ceasefire once mandatory war time is over, to discuss what to do next with the king.

In charge of All of the Kingdoms Fighting Men

Commanders- In charge of their respective Battalion, the only ones who get orders directly from the battlemaster

In charge of whichever battalion they are in charge of   
Battalion \= However many flag groups appointed by BattleMaster

Captains \- Take orders strictly from there respected commanders

In charge of 5 groups of flag armies.

Sarj- Takes orders straight from the Captains 

In charge of there specific flagged company

Commanders have authority to make as many captains as they believe they need, same for captains. BattleMasters can decide how many of each is needed as well.

Once agreed upon The battlemaster delegates which battalion is going to march to.

***Soldiers: The positions above are very prestigious and rewarded to only the citizens who have proved invaluable to the BattleMaster and the Commander and so on. Most citizens will participate as the bulk of the army, the grunts, however the higher ups forget how much the grunts can turn the tide of battle…***

***Once the war begins it is how it would be in real life, Anarchy, Once you are on the battlefield it's all open. Everyone who enforces the rules and dictates where battles take place are comfortable sitting at home while you are risking your life every minute you are there. Become Renown for your skill with the blade, a turncoat, a spy, a strategist, a healer, someone who is just trying to survive and flee. band with a group of friends you’ve made during the war and break off to create your own kingdom\!***

***The field of battle is for the soldiers who spill their blood.***

***(Magic may be restricted if abused during battles)***

About Us

What separates us from all the other WorldBox videos you will see, is the dedication to world building and “living” in said world for weeks of real life time on one living planet.

We want to combine RPG elements and a multiplayer experience to a incredibly minute detail.

All what you know an love of WorldBox has been restricted and made into a community driven task. What that means is Any Earthquakes, diseases, rebellions that you see are in the world will be made by one of the “citizens”. We strive to be as hands-free as possible and let the world run its self.

Those “Citizens” are you, the player. The heart and soul of the entire world. Our goal is to create and host a server(s) that can host hundreds if not thousands of players to own and control 1 sprite in the world.

————————-  
crafting/professions sneak peek

In the future, with that sprite you will be able to

Become king and dictate policies in your kingdom

Become a sell sword selling your services to the highest bidder

A smith crafting the finest armaments

Cartographer traveling across the world and creating maps to sell to other citizens who have no idea what the rest of the world will  
Look like.

Healer healing diseased or injured people from battle or disease.

Or a simple boatswain crafting, selling, and sailing the finest boats in the sea.

And more\! See the video Class/Professions to see the details and how we plan to make these happen.  
—————————-

We will keep the world running and live streamed the entire time for people to see and participate in events ranging from local towns to world altering.

Everything is permanent, whatever happens in the world in those 7 days stays like that until the next world begins.

Once the 7 day timer ends the world is then saved and uploaded for everyone to enjoy.

——————-

New Systems:

We plan on implementing all kinds of features including a War-time hierarchy System , Magic system, Political kingdom system, currency, class,professions. Etc.

if you wish to know more about any of these certain features we will be creating separate videos dedicated to each one of them in full detail as it will be too much to explain here.

——————-

Community Driven

Everything we are building comes with the community in mind first. What we want to do is build and have the people decide on there own how they would like to use it, that’s what makes a static world breathe life and dynamics. Creating fictional history in real time.

——————

Inspiration

If you are still curious about what we might represent, think DnD, Game of Thrones, MapWars, Mount and blade Bannerlord, and crusader kings.

With every system we implement we took these as our inspirations and source.

————-

“Historical” Documentation

I, personally, love history. especially fictional history since ours can be a bit bleak and sad most of the time. However I always saw the problem with fictional history is that it has already been set in stone and written out for us to enjoy, usually that’s okay if the writings good but I for one, always had a “what if this happened instead of this” hoping other possibilities were to happen instead. Questioning canon I believe is a stone cold truth that is bitter sweet, so I thought why not create the canon as we go\! While your citizen is living in that world you are participating in active history, making your digital pixelated footprint in that world for all to see. Even with that concept people who weren’t in that first world will wish they were. Which is why we recycle and create a new world every couple weeks for new people to join from the very beginning\!

With that being said another goal is too make a wiki page, documenting every major and minor event occurring in that world and having its own separate wiki page for all to enjoy after the world ends so people can reminisce and see the impact there character had.

It will display

what major wars happened and when  
(Green vs Purple 2239 AT)

* Major battles that occurred  
* Rare and powerful monsters and citizens alike and there deeds.  
* Masterfully crafted equipment

Would even like to implement a battle map updating every 200 years or so or whenever a major war has taken place.

———————

Closing Remarks

With all that being said, This is a massive project we are taking on, everything fully conceptualized and originally designed from the ground up. So creating the code and art work for this will take a massive amount of  
time as it’s just me and one other worldbox developer currently.

UNFORTUNATELY We do have real lives to maintain to afford utilities and rent so that will also hinder the release date as we can not put our 100% focus on the project.

Down below is a Patreon/ kickstarter fundraiser, However, this is me real talk. this isn’t going to a charity or any altruistic goal like that. It will be going directly to me to be able to pay myself to continue putting overseeing the production to make sure all my concepts are fleshed out as well as financing developers who are not interested to do it out of the good of there heart but will put in work programming/designing aspects for a fee. This will speed up the release date exponentially.

There’s no other way for you to trust me besides knowing this entire idea and concept came from me as well as this video edited and I even wrote a script in my notes app late at night after coming up with the fact I was going to make it myself. I had asked the worldbox steam community and the discord community for assistance to no avail besides some slight help from a developer who I hope to work with in the future.

the expected release as of right now will be in late 2024 early 2025\. but if we are able to get more people on the team that date could be reduced majorly.

Prometheus :

There stood a world where our first story takes place… a small terrestrial planet, Prometheus.

The world is beautiful, quiet, peaceful. 2 continents , BayMin in the NorthWest, Cythera in the South East.

At the beginning of time there was only one way to each continent, They called it the crossing.

Before primitive life came along to the world the land was roamed by nothing but beautiful beast and the lush green grass, with the cycle of nature continuing.

Year 1 BT Before Thiago

Than.. Man arrived, seemingly “out of nowhere” arriving in the Cythera.

They remained local and sparse for a 1000 years , learning how to fish, build  
homes, and to sail once they find a river.
