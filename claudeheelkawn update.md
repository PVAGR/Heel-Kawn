```csharp
[BepInPlugin("com.heelkawn.worldbox.multiplayer", "WorldBox Multiplayer Mod", "1.0.0")]
public class WorldBoxMultiplayerMod : BaseUnityPlugin
{
    private MultiplayerSyncManager _syncManager;
    private TwitchIntegrationService _twitchService;
    private PlayerDataManager _dataManager;
    
    private void Awake()
    {
        var harmony = new Harmony("com.heelkawn.worldbox.multiplayer");
        harmony.PatchAll();
        
        // Initialize core services
        _syncManager = gameObject.AddComponent<MultiplayerSyncManager>();
        _twitchService = gameObject.AddComponent<TwitchIntegrationService>();
        _dataManager = new PlayerDataManager();
    }
}
```

**Key Implementation Steps:**
- **Week 1**: Set up development environment, BepInEx framework, and basic plugin structure
