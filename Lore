# Heel-Kawn Universe

*PVAGames presents the WorldBox universe: Heel-Kawn!*

All the worlds you will reside and/or view over will take place in the universe of Heel-Kawn.

---

## How to Play

To join the world, type one of the assigned numbers below and (optionally) the territory you’d like to be placed inside of.

This is a realistic simulated virtual experience: there won’t be action 24/7 for 2–3 decades. We could have absolute peace, with people simply building their cities and leveling up.

You can spawn into 5 units:

1. Human  
2. Elf  
3. Dwarf  
4. Orc  
5. Other (Bug that doesn’t impact the world, Any Animal, Zombie, or Skeleton)

**Example:**  
`3, Unlanded`  
`1, Kishyg Kingdom`

## Currency System: Krond

- *Earn Krond strictly based on kills. 25 Kr per kill.*
- “Krond” is the in-game currency you earn passively just by having a citizen in the game.
- Krond allows you to impact the world in multiple ways, such as:
  - Utilizing the Magic System (see below)
  - Granting new traits
  - Summoning citizens
  - Calling for an election in a kingdom for you or someone else to become a lord or king (only against OTHER human players)

## Citizen: Classes and Professions

Each player who joins must be a follower; every subscriber also gets a citizen with 3 minor traits at the start. There will be a VEGames system that implements grander RPG elements.

### Classes

- **Bila** (Warfare)

Each class has 3 separate subclasses.  
*Example Bila subclasses:*
- Duelist (excels at 1v1 and 1v10 battles)
- Strategist (can pan the camera further out to see more of the battlefield)
- Battlemage (can cast destructive magic during battles/war)

### Professions

Every player citizen starts at 0 in each; you choose what to focus on. Once you have over 100 skills, you are locked into that profession (up to 2 professions).

- **Boatsman** — Only ones who can build and sail boats
- **Trader** — Only ones who can buy/sell goods

---

## Community and History

- All actions are streamed and chronicled in the “Atlas of Prometheus” Google Doc and the Discord server’s `#world-history`.
- After each 7-day cycle, the world is archived, and major/minor events are recorded for posterity.

## Inspiration

If you are curious about the spirit of Heel-Kawn, think DnD, Game of Thrones, MapWars, Mount & Blade: Bannerlord, and Crusader Kings.

With every system, we aim to create a collaborative, ever-evolving fictional history—one that is built by you.

## Closing

This is a massive, community-driven project. Every player is a citizen. Every session is history in the making. Welcome to Heel-Kawn!
