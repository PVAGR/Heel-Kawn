***War :***  
The only person who can declare war is the ruler of the realm. The king can NOT declare war instantly, it has to go through a process and through the right people in order to go through.

When the King wishes to declare war they must prepare months in in-game time or hours in real-time.

He first must go to his personal kings council, in which they take a vote on whether to proceed with the logistics and expenses of what's to come with war. if they vote 3-2 for the war they can go to the next step.

If the first council goes through then the grand emisar must immediately call upon his messengers throughout the realm and let them know to send their local lords of each village to the Capital which depending on the distance may take a week or two of in-game time or 30 minutes of real-time.  

Once every lord arrives the senate vote takes place. so around 50-60 votes might take place with each lord having 1 vote. (maybe 2-5 votes per lord depending on conditions met, {been through multiple wars and won, loyalty, kills, etc.} 

so if the vote is voted 34-33 for, the war prep continues, and vice-versa.

Once a decision takes place from the aggressor the Grand Emisar must immediately send the defender the declaration.

If the aggressor kingdom fails to do this condition then any other kingdom or village can revolt without giving them notice during that war time.

the BattleMaster and Ruler Convene to check each village's realm and how many people they can muster to fight. 

They come up with a quota for each lord with how many soldiers to bring from their respective lands. 

They have them meet at a respected place to organize.

The lords go and tell the citizens what is going to happen in the next 2-3 months of in-game time or hour of real-time.

Once the armies have gathered for both respected kingdoms (depending on how large the respected kingdoms are) 

The BattleMaster may separate the army into multiple battalions. (Western battalion,Northern battalion, etc.)

After this a hierarchy is established on the battlefield:

BattleMaster  
Commanders  
Captains  
Sarj

BattleMaster- meets with the BattleMaster of the defending kingdom to Oversee every theater of war and discuss where their respective Battalions are going to be battling with the other. Each battle site must be agreed upon by both parties.

only required for the first battle for each battalion.

 Can declare temporary ceasefire once mandatory war time is over, to discuss what to do next with the king.

In charge of All of the Kingdoms Fighting Men

Commanders- In charge of their respective Battalion, the only ones who get orders directly from the battlemaster

In charge of whichever battalion they are in charge of   
Battalion \= However many flag groups appointed by BattleMaster

Captains \- Take orders strictly from there respected commanders

In charge of 5 groups of flag armies.

Sarj- Takes orders straight from the Captains 

In charge of there specific flagged company

Commanders have authority to make as many captains as they believe they need, same for captains. BattleMasters can decide how many of each is needed as well.

Once agreed upon The battlemaster delegates which battalion is going to march to.

***Soldiers: The positions above are very prestigious and rewarded to only the citizens who have proved invaluable to the BattleMaster and the Commander and so on. Most citizens will participate as the bulk of the army, the grunts, however the higher ups forget how much the grunts can turn the tide of battle…***

***Once the war begins it is how it would be in real life, Anarchy, Once you are on the battlefield it's all open. Everyone who enforces the rules and dictates where battles take place are comfortable sitting at home while you are risking your life every minute you are there. Become Renown for your skill with the blade, a turncoat, a spy, a strategist, a healer, someone who is just trying to survive and flee. band with a group of friends you’ve made during the war and break off to create your own kingdom\!***

***The field of battle is for the soldiers who spill their blood.***

***(Magic may be restricted if abused during battles)***
