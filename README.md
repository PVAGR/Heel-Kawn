## üè∞ The Vision

Heel-Kawn is more than a mod; it's a persistent universe where Twitch viewers become citizens of a living world. Through chat commands, they farm, build, wage war, and cast magic, creating a collaborative story that is documented in a living wiki. Every seven-day session is a unique chapter in the history of the world of Prometheus.

**Core Philosophy:** "You are not just playing a game. You are conducting an orchestra of chaos and story."
