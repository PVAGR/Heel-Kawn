# Heel-Kawn WorldBox Multiplayer Mod
## Project Overview
Heel-Kawn is a community-driven multiplayer mod for WorldBox, designed to create a living, evolving world shaped by player actions, streaming events, and collaborative storytelling. 

### Vision
To build a persistent, lore-rich universe where players, streamers, and viewers interact in real time, influencing the world’s narrative, politics, and technological progress.
