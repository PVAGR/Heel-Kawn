## ⚔️ War System

Only the ruler can declare war, and it must be approved through a process:

1. **King’s Council Vote:**  
   - If passed, proceed to next step.
2. **Senate Vote:**  
   - Lords of each village must travel (time-based) to capital for the vote.
   - Votes may be weighted (e.g., by war wins, loyalty, kills).
3. **Declaration:**  
   - If vote passes, Grand Emisar notifies defender.
   - Failure to follow this allows revolts.

**Battle Preparation:**
- Quotas for lords to muster armies
- Army gathering at a chosen site
- Battalion and hierarchy assignment:  
  *BattleMaster → Commanders → Captains → Sarj (Sergeants) → Soldiers*

**Battlefield Rules:**
- Once battle begins, it’s open/chaotic (anarchy)
- “Grunts” (normal citizens) can turn the tide
- Notable deeds are chronicled for history
