# The Heel-Kawn Universe

<<<<<<< HEAD
Welcome to the lore foundation for the Heel-Kawn Multiplayer Mod! This universe is a blend of mythic chaos, emergent storytelling, and collaborative legend-making. The world is shaped by the actions, prayers, and ambitions of its villagers—your Twitch chat.

---

## The World

Heel-Kawn is a fractured land of competing kingdoms, ancient magic, and meddling gods. Every villager is a soul torn from the Aether, summoned by the call of a streamer. Villages rise and fall by the whims of chat and the mood of the gods.

---

## Core Factions

- **The Villagers:** Ordinary souls, each controlled by a Twitch user. They can farm, build, pray, and fight.
- **The Villages:** Collections of villagers, sometimes united, sometimes at odds. Each has a distinct name and (potentially) culture.
- **The Kingdoms:** Greater powers formed by the union of villages. They wage war, broker peace, and enact divine rituals.
- **The Gods:** (Later Tech) Streamer, mods, or randomly chosen viewers. Can smite, bless, or wreak havoc.

---

## The Gods and Prayers

As the mod grows, prayers from villagers may influence the world—calling for rain, requesting a miracle, or begging for mercy. The gods (streamer, mods, or AI) may answer, ignore, or twist these prayers.

---

## The Cycle of Life

1. **Summoning**: A viewer joins chat and types `!join`. Their soul is born as a villager in Heel-Kawn.
2. **Living**: Villagers can move, work, form friendships, or start trouble.
3. **Death & Respawn**: When a villager dies, they may return—reborn with memories, or changed by their experience.

---

## Timeline & Major Events

- **The First Summoning:** The day the Heel-Kawn mod goes live. The world is empty, waiting for souls.
- **The Age of Prayers:** Villagers learn to call upon gods for help (Tech Level III+).
- **The Wars of the Kingdoms:** Villages form alliances and wage spectacular wars (Tech Level IV+).
- **The Coming of Miracles:** Gods intervene openly, reshaping the land (Tech Level V+).

## Philosophy

Heel-Kawn is not just a mod—it is a "machine for making legends." Every action by chat can become a story. Every stream is a new chapter.

## Contributing to the Lore

All players are invited to create stories, write village histories, or propose new mechanics. Open an issue or PR!
