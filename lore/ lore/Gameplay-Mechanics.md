# Heel-Kawn Multiplayer Mod – Gameplay Mechanics

This page describes the planned and current gameplay mechanics for the Heel-Kawn Multiplayer Mod for WorldBox.

---

## 1. Joining the World

- **!join** – Any Twitch chat user can type `!join` to appear as a unique villager in the world.
- Each villager is linked to a Twitch username and persists for the session.
- Villagers spawn in a random or default location (customizable in future tech levels).

---

## 2. Actions & Commands

Players interact with the world by typing chat commands:

- **!move [direction]** – Queue a move action (e.g. `!move north`, `!move southwest`).
- **!pray** – Attempt to pray to the gods (future: triggers events or requests intervention).
- **!farm**, **!gather**, **!build** – Planned; perform resource actions.
- **!village**, **!kingdom** – Check or switch allegiances (future).
- **!help** – Show available commands.

Actions are queued and processed in order, subject to cooldowns.

## 3. Villager Traits & Progression

- Each villager can have traits (e.g. brave, clever, lucky).
- Traits may evolve based on in-game actions or random events.
- Later: Experience, leveling, roles (farmer, warrior, priest).

---

## 4. Villages & Kingdoms

- Villagers are grouped into villages.
- Villages may merge to form kingdoms.
- Future: diplomacy, war, alliances, village upgrades.

---

## 5. Prayers & God Powers

- Villagers can pray for miracles (!pray).
- The streamer (or designated "gods") can answer, ignore, or twist prayers.
- Later: automated god powers, smites, blessings, miracles.

---

## 6. Death & Respawn

- Villagers may die from violence, hunger, or disaster.
- Dead villagers can be respawned (with penalty or memory, depending on lore).
- Later: Afterlife, rebirth systems.

---

## 7. Persistence

- Villager data persists for the session.
- Planned: persistent saves, stats, and world state between streams.

---

## 8. Lore & Events

- All actions and major events are logged for storytelling.
- Chat can influence world lore, holidays, or legendary events.

---

## 9. Anti-Spam & Balance

- Action queue/cooldown per villager.
- Max actions per tick.
- Future: anti-bot and fairness systems.
